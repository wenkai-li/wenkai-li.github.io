I am a 23 Fall master in [<span style="color: #8B0000;">Carnegie Mellon University</span>](https://www.cmu.edu/). My program is Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems(MIIS) at [<span style="color: #8B0000;">Language Technology Institution(LTI)</span>](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/), advised by Prof. [<span style="color: #8B0000;">Mona Diab</span>](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/people/faculty/diab-mona.html), [<span style="color: #8B0000;">Daniel Fried</span>](https://dpfried.github.io/) and [<span style="color: #8B0000;">Maarten Sap</span>](https://maartensap.com/). I received my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from [<span style="color: #8B0000;">Northeastern University(China)</span>](https://english.neu.edu.cn/). During my undergraduate, I was interested in Software development and completed projects in distributed system and microservices system development.

In 2023, I began my research career, my research interests are on the <span style="color: #8B0000;">NLP, LLM Reasoning, Social Agents, Multi-agents system, Responsible AI for Social Good, AI-Human Interaction, Multimodal Machine Learning and Information Retrieval</span>. My primary goal is to advance the development of LLMs with enhanced social intelligence and practical reasoning capabilities, while also building better AI agents and applying them in real-world contexts, particularly emphasizing multi-agent collaboration and human-agent interaction. My research focuses on enabling these systems to better perceive and simulate human mental states and emotional contexts, fostering AI that can effectively address real-world human needs. Ultimately, I aim to contribute to building reliable, socially responsible, and trustworthy AI systems that integrate seamlessly into diverse applications.
