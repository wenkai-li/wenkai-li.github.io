I am a MIIS master in <a href="https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/"><span style="color: rgb(199, 46, 237);">LTI</span></a> at Carnegie Mellon University, advise by Prof. <a href="https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/people/faculty/diab-mona.html"><span style="color: rgb(199, 46, 237);">Mona Diab</span></a>, and also work with <a href="https://maartensap.com/"><span style="color: rgb(199, 46, 237);">Maarten Sap</span></a> and <a href="https://dpfried.github.io/"><span style="color: rgb(199, 46, 237);">Daniel Fried</span></a>. My research explores the LLM Reasoning, Social Responsible AI, Post-training, Agentic system, Latent Space Reasoning and AI-Human Interaction. I received my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from <a href="https://english.neu.edu.cn/"><span style="color:rgb(199, 46, 237);">Northeastern University (China)</span></a>. During my undergraduate, I was interested in Software development and completed projects in distributed system and microservices system development.

My research goal focuses on building reliable and deployable AI agents capable of operating robustly in real-world environments. I am particularly interested in enhancing LLMsâ€™ social and causal reasoning abilities to better align their behavior with human expectations, ultimately making LLM-based agents more reliable, safe, interpretable, and socially accepted.

<!-- My research interests are on the <span style="color: rgb(199, 46, 237);">LLM Reasoning, Post-training, Alignment, Agentic system, Responsible AI for Social Good, Latent Space Reasoning and AI-Human Interaction</span>.  -->

<!-- My primary goal is to advance the development of LLMs with enhanced social intelligence and practical reasoning capabilities, while also building better AI agents and applying them in real-world contexts, particularly emphasizing multi-agent collaboration and human-agent interaction. My research focuses on enabling these systems to better perceive and simulate human mental states and emotional contexts, fostering AI that can effectively address real-world human needs. Ultimately, I aim to contribute to building reliable, socially responsible, and trustworthy AI systems that integrate seamlessly into diverse applications.
